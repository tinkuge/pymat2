This project is development of original <a href='http://sourceforge.net/projects/pymat/'>pymat</a> project,
that seems to be dead for a six years by now.

I've currently compiling (and using) it for Python 2.6 for Windows with Matlab 7
and Python 2.5 for Linux. There has been reported that it is possible to compile and use Pymat2 for OS X.

Since I've currently using given project for my research, any feedback is highly desirable.

Please note that pymat2 supports getting of multidimensional arrays from Matlab to Python, but currently does not support setting of arrays with more than two dimensions in Matlab from Python. (Since old `pymat` code is used for setting arrays).
